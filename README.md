The PyCity Schools Analysis begins with calculating the total number of schools, total number of students, and total budget. Then, the average math and reading scores are calculated, along with the percentage of students who passed math, reading, and both math and reading.

Next, a summary of each school is provided, based on type of school, total student count, per capita spending, average test scores, passing math and reading scores, individually and together. 

The highest and lowest performing schools are then determined, followed by math and reading scores broken down by grade.

Finally, scores by school spending, school size, and school type are calculated. 

One conclusion that can be drawn is that overall, charter schools have a higher math and reading scores and overall passing percent than district schools. 

Another conclusion is that, somewhat counterintuitively, per student spending does not seem to correlate to higher test scores.
